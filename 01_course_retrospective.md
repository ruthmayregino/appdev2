## I. What went well
During the AppDev1 course, I was able to learn and understand the basic foundation of React, especially how component-based code structure works. I became familiar with how React components are organized and how the framework functions overall. This helped me understand how modern web applications are structured.

In terms of skills, I am still working on improving my front-end skills, but I was able to apply basic concepts and understand how design and structure affect user experience.

## II. What went wrong / Challenges
One of my main challenges was during the later lessons of the course, where I found it difficult to keep up mentally. At that time, I was under a lot of pressure because I was handling a dual role, which caused emotional and mental exhaustion.

Because of this, I was not consistent in catching up with the lessons and I was not able to fully focus on some topics. There were moments where I had to prioritize project responsibilities over learning, which affected my overall progress.

## III. Key Learnings
One of my biggest takeaways from the course was learning the foundation of React and understanding which languages and tools are used in web development. I also learned important techniques in translating JavaScript into JSX, which is essential when working with React.

Additionally, I learned the importance of micro-commits in GitHub to properly save progress and avoid losing work. The use of repositories also became clearer to me, especially in terms of collaboration, version control, and project organization.

## IV. Areas for Improvement
Moving forward, I want to put more effort into understanding the proper structuring of code. Although development is not the main path I want to pursue, having knowledge of how code works internally is very important for my role as a Project Manager.

Understanding the implementation process will help me properly guide developers, spot issues, and communicate requirements more effectively. I also want to make more effort to ensure that my code works and to understand the logic behind it, even if I am not the one writing complex code.

## V. Expectations for Mobile Development (AppDev2)
For AppDev2, my main goal is to learn proper code structuring and how to identify faults or issues in development. Since I will be handling different developer for our capstone project, this knowledge will be very important for me.

I hope the lessons will be explained in a simple, logical way, preferably with examples or analogies, so that the concepts are easier to understand and apply.

In terms of support, the guidance I need most is focused on structuring, as this will help me keep up with the course and perform better in both development and project management roles.
